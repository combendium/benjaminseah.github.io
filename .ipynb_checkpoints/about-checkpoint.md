# About Me

Hello! I'm Benjamin Seah. <br>
I'm an apsiring data scientist and a former chemist. This may seem quite a surprising change but it is preciely my background in dealing with Quality Control and Quality Assurance in a manufacturing environment that has honed my skills in balancing stakeholder requirements, teamwork and strong problem-solving to meet targets. These are now assets I bring with me in my data science pursuit.
